Minecraft clone in golang

I am doing this project to learn golang (You can check my [other repository](https://github.com/piochelepiotr/minecraftClone) for a c++ version.
So the code for this repo is also taken from the YouTube channel [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUkRj4qoT1bsWpE_C8lZYoQ)
